# UrsinaWiltShowcase
A short demo I created in Ursina for a chance to show off my epic coding skills. (I don't know how to code, college better straighten me out when I get there.

I may end up building on this demo in the far future, which is why I'm making releases and whatnot. Who knows? It might even become a full game...
